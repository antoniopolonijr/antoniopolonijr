# 👨‍💻 Antonio Poloni

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a 36-year-old developer from Piracicaba/SP, Brazil. I'm passionate about soccer and RPGs, and I share my coding journey with Yoda — my loyal feline sidekick who's always by my side.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a career switcher with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a growing passion for web development. With a strong foundation in logical thinking and problem-solving, I’m now focused on building modern, accessible, and user-friendly web applications.

Over the past year, I’ve committed to a consistent learning path through platforms like Frontend Masters and freeCodeCamp. I’ve completed the Responsive Web Design Certification and the Frontend Masters Bootcamp, and I'm currently deepening my skills in React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

My goal is to become a front-end developer who writes clean, maintainable code and builds inclusive digital experiences. One of my latest projects is NoCliques, a team generator app that creates fair soccer teams by analyzing player skills and positions. I manage the project using GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and GitHub Projects for full visibility and agile tracking.

I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and opportunities to grow. Let’s build something great together!

🌍 Languages: Portuguese (native), English (advanced)
